     <li> I was studying at SK BANDAR TASIK PUTERI for 6 years. I was an active student because i often join many clubs and school activities. I also active in sports where i played netball and my team won 1st place in a competition back in 2015. I also managed to get 3As and 2Bs in UPSR. I was grateful after all despite of being an active student in sport field, I still managed to get a great UPSR result. </li>

	 <li> In highschool (SMK BANDAR TASIK PUTERI) I was rather a quiet student and I gave my all on academic performance. I did not join any clubs and I no longer active in sports because my goal was to ace in my SPM so I have to working extra hard and those efforts was worth it after all. I managed to get 7As 1B ans 1C in my SPM which was my target result. Im so grateful until this day. </li>

	 <li> Entering university in UiTM REMBAU, I am the happiest person on earth because going into a university is always a dream of mine. I was offered to furthering my education in Information Management. In this course, I met so many people and get along very well my classmates. </li>
