 Hello, my name is Yasmin Nadirah Binti Kamaruddin. I was born in Pahang on 10th April 20 years ago. I am currently studying in UiTM Rembau in Information Management program. This is my last semester and I am about to complete my diploma journey. </li>

     <li> I have many hobbies that I enjoy in my free times. It includes reading books, drawing, watching videos on YouTube and many more. I enjoy my free time alone in the room and do many things on my own. In conclusion, I enjoy my own company very much.</li>

    <li> These days, I really love watching self-growth videos on YouTube. It helps me a lot in order for me to learn how to accept myself as who I am and also helps me getting through some big major events that happened in my life. I am currently working on to heal my inner child and reflecting myself as a whole person. I have my two favourite YouTube/Influencer that changed my perspective on life. There are TheWizardLiz and Persephonesmind. I will put a link down below as a suggestion from one of those videos i watch often. </li>

    <li> I also enjoy reading. I am currently reading an e-book named "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY". It is a good book to read but quite difficult to understand as the book is an old published on 1800s and the english used in the book is old. </li>
